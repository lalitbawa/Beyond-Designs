Welcome to my Web App. It is created with Html, Tailwind CSS, React and Redux for front-end with various npm packaages that you can find in the package.json file.
For back-end It makes use of express JS for Rest Api and mongodb as database.


For frontend - 
To start the frontend, go inside the front end folder. right click and select open with code(vscode) and then open your terminal. Type "npm install" and it will install all the dependencies from package.json file. Then type "npm start" and it will start the application in your default browser.

For backend - 
To get started, go inside the backend folder. right click and select open with code(vscode). Then open your terminal and type "npm install" and it will install all the dependencies from the package.json. Then type "npx nodemon index.js" to start the backend. PLEASE NOTE - if you have installed nodemon globally, you can run the application by typing "nodemon index.js" in the terminal. 

Once the backend and frontend servers have started, the application will start working flawlessly.
